These examples show, how to check if a specific child (right side), which uses a library (left side)
has a specific method implemented or not. For example if the "left side" relies on this (child's)method.

Normally, if this method was non-existent, the code would only fail at runtime when this method-call is reached.
But the examples in this chapter show how to check right after the execution of the program.
